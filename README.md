The mechanics of the game are as follows:
The game presents the player with programming-related questions and a set of answer options.
The player has to select one option and submit their answer before the timer runs out. After submitting an answer, the player's response is evaluated, and the result is displayed.
If the player's answer is correct, their score will increase by one point, and the AI score will remain the same. If the player's answer is incorrect, their score will not increase, and the AI score will increase by one point.
The game will continue until all the questions are answered, or the timer runs out. The player's final score will be displayed at the end of the game.
